🔍 Malware Data Extraction Project
This project automates the extraction of malware-related data from webpages using the following steps:

📝 Workflow
Scraping URLs:
The URLs of malware-related pages are scraped using Selenium and saved in urls_malware.txt.

Extracting Content:
The extract_section_content.py script reads urls_malware.txt, scrapes dynamic content from the webpages, and saves the extracted text in the /data folder.

Explanation:
A description.pdf file provides an explanation of the selected features from each webpage and the rationale behind the choices.

🛠️ Tools & Techniques
Selenium WebDriver: Automates the browser for scraping with anti-detection techniques, such as:

Disabling Automation Flags: Prevents the browser from identifying the automation tool (e.g., --disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled).

User-Agent Randomization: Uses a random user-agent to make requests appear as if they are from different browsers or users.

Human-Like Delays: Introduces randomized delays between actions (time.sleep() and random.uniform()) to simulate human behavior and avoid triggering bot detection.

BeautifulSoup: Parses and extracts content from the webpage HTML.

Python Libraries: Utilizes os, time, and random for file handling, delays, and error management.

📁 Project Files
urls_malware.txt: Contains the scraped URLs.

extract_section_content.py: The script that extracts and saves content from the URLs.

/data: Folder containing the saved extracted data.

description.pdf: A PDF explaining the features extracted and their relevance.

🚀 Features
